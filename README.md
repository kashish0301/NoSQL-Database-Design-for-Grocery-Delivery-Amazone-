## Case Background
Amazone has decided to expand its operations by delivering fresh groceries. To offer same-day and instant grocery delivery service, the company has partnered with a UK groceries retailer, Morrison. This partnership will enable Amazone to do fresh and same-day grocery delivery. Amazone has decided to experiment with same-day and instant grocery delivery using Manchester. Six Morrison grocery stores have been chosen for instant pick-up and delivery by delivery drivers who are Amazon partners.
